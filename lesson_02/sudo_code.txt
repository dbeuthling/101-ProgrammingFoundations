#a method that returns the sum of two integers

---CASUAL---

Given we have two integers.
call the first integer 'first'
call the second integer 'second'
add 'first' and 'second'
call the result 'result'
print out 'result'

---FORMAL---

START

#given a two integers

SET integer 1 = x
SET integer 2 = y
SET result = x + y

PRINT result

#a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string
#that is all those strings concatenated together

---CASUAL---

Given we have a array of strings
start with an empty variable called 'sentence'
iterate through each of the strings in the array
add each string to the end of 'sentence'
print out 'sentence'

---FORMAL---

START

# Given an array of strings called 'words'

SET iterator = 1
SET sentence = new string of connected 'words'

WHILE iterator < total number of words in 'words'
  

#a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a
#new array with every other element
Given we have and array of integers
set a new empty array called 'every_other'
iterate over the array of integers
the first integer in the original array is in position 0, the second in 1, etc
take the first integer in the original array and add it to the end of 'every_other'
start a loop that adds 2 to the position
take that integer and add it to 'every_other'
stop when you reach the end of the original array
